He worked on putting together a list of websites that were most visited and then filtering out them out to look at what odd websites were visited by all the employees; this didn't really lead to a conclusion. He looked at if there was an oddity in the attachment sizes. After the group was able to come up with suspects, he looked at any odd information from all csv files regarding the suspects. \n",

    "    * Ronnie worked with data visualization and putting together the set of people that could be suspects. Through looking at different plots, he was able to come to a conclusion that we should start looking at the odd times that peple were visiting their computers (logon and device connects). He then looked at suspicious activies in each data set regarding these individuals to try to come up with a conclusion. "

Later, as we continued to investigate Chaney more, we saw that after he left the company, his name still appeared in the emails data set but as a foreign contact. There were emails being sent to 'Chaney.Sean.Fuentes@boeing.com' which was more suspicious. The person who was sending these emails was an employee named Suki Linda Odom, a Computer Programmer. We observed some suspicious behavior by her as well (connecting during off hours and sending emails with a lot of attachments to people like Chaney) but we were unable to draw any definitive conclusion pertaining her. \n",

    "Chaney must have already had an offer lined up at Boeing (assuming because of the email he received from that Boeing contact in early May) so he didn't care too much about his current job. He would always be browsing online during work hours, which probably meant he wasn't too focused on work anyways. Then in July, a month before he switched to Boeing, since he hated his current job, he decided to exploit his current company before leaving. He must have waited until July to do so because he needed to wait until his job at Boeing was confirmed. Following all of this, he simply quit at this company."

    "Of this off hour connections data, the last 4 were after Chaney both left the company and joined Boeing. This could mean that she was a connection he had during his time at DTAA and someone who might still be up to some sketchy business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 last dates cross-checked against the emails that Chaney received from her at his Boeing adress, also have some correlation. Following her 7/30/17 connection at ~5am, she emailed Chaney the same day at 8am. And then on 09/09/17, she sent 2 emails to Chaney, one which also contained another external recipient - Lacy.Nicole.Lindsey@northropgrumman.com and this was a day after she was connecting at 3am on 09/08/17. These findings suggest that Suki may have had some involvement in Chaney's plans (or future plans) or be a secondary suspect for a future attack if she hasn't already done something yet. "
